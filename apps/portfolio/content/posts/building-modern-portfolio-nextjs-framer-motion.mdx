Creating a portfolio that stands out in 2026 requires more than just a list of projects. It requires an **experience**. In this article, we'll explore how to combine the power of Next.js with the fluid animations of Framer Motion to create something truly special.

### Why Next.js?

Next.js remains the gold standard for React applications due to its excellent performance, SEO capabilities, and the flexibility of the App Router. For a portfolio, speed is everything. We want our visitors to feel the snapiness of the UI immediately.

### Enter Framer Motion

Animations shouldn't be an afterthought. With Framer Motion, we can create gesture-based interactions and scroll-triggered animations that feel natural. The `layoutId` prop alone is a game-changer for shared element transitions.

> "Animation is not just about making things move; it's about making things feel alive."

### Combining the Two

By wrapping our components in `motion` elements, we can easily add entrance animations. Using a shared `AnimatedSection` component ensures consistency across all pages of our portfolio.
