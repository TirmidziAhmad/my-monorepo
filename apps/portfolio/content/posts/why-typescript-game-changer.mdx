If you're still writing vanilla JavaScript in 2026, you're missing out on the single most significant productivity boost in modern web development: **TypeScript**.

### Safety First

The primary benefit of TypeScript is catching errors early. Instead of finding out a variable is `undefined` at runtime, your editor tells you immediately. This "shift left" on error detection saves countless hours of debugging.

### Better Tooling

TypeScript isn't just about types; it's about the developer experience. Autocomplete, jump-to-definition, and refactoring tools become significantly more powerful when the editor understands the shape of your data.

### Documentation as Code

In a team environment, types act as living documentation. You don't need to ask your teammate what an object contains; you just look at the interface definition.
