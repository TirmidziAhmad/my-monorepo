Layouts haven't been this exciting since the early days of the web. With the combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox, there's virtually no design that we can't implement with clean, performant CSS.

### Grid for Macro, Flexbox for Micro

A good rule of thumb is to use CSS Grid for the overall page structure (macro layout) and Flexbox for the alignment of items within components (micro layout). This gives you the best of both worlds: two-dimensional control for the page and one-dimensional control for the details.

### The Power of `subgrid`

CSS Grid's `subgrid` feature has finally achieved broad browser support. It allows nested grids to inherit the tracks of their parents, making complex alignments across card components a breeze.

### Responsive Without Media Queries?

With `minmax()`, `auto-fit`, and `auto-fill`, we can often create layouts that respond beautifully to screen size changes without writing a single media query. This simplifies our CSS and makes it more robust.
